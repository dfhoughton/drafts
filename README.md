writing on various topics

I often have musings that interest me. I tell them to someone. They vanish away. The person I told them to
moves or dies. Life moves on.

I don't like this rhythm. I haven't gotten all I could out of the musings, either by turning them over in
my mind or sharing them.

I am creating this repository so I can give myself writing assignments as issues. The issues will become markdown
documents I refine over time. Why not create a substack as my wife [P.J. Melton](https://thebiggestlittlethings.substack.com/)
has done and urges me to do? Well, I might at some point, but this is more familiar to me and requires less effort.
Also, I like that work in github is never done.

## Dedication

I dedicate the work in this repository to P.J. Melton and anyone I have ever shared musings with.
