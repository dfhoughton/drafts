# Puffy Space

This is an idea that started germinating in me when I first took whatever the quantum physics course was called at UVa
back in 1989 or 1990 or so. It was one of the best physics courses I took. The professor was young, engaged, and interesting.
Somewhat unusually for physics professors in my experience up to that point, he he was a good teacher. He could perceive the
confusion of his students and make adjustments on the fly. So I enjoyed it immensely. Sadly, I had already decided that I
couldn't complete a physics major. I just found the experience of sitting in most of the lectures too unpleasant. The boredom
and depression set in too quickly. I had to do crossword puzzles or I would fall asleep. I am not boasting. Somehow the flourescent
lights, grayness, and monotony made paying attention almost impossible for me. It didn't react well with my pre-existing
insomnia and depression.

Anyway, this particular teacher was good and there was natural light. I enjoyed his lectures. The ideas he introduced me to
remained, echoing in my head as I stumbled through to graduation. The two ideas that were dancing around each other were this:
the quantum wave function for a particular particle (or object or whatever) reaches out to the limits of the universe. If you
square it, it's value at any point is a value between 0 and 1; it is the probability that the particle will be at that point
when you look for it. If you sum these values over the entire universe it comes to 1 -- the particle is certain to be somewhere
in the universe.

Beside this there is general relativity, which says that space is curved by mass. The curvature, the deviation from
flatness, is in a direction perpendicular to those we perceive. You see this curvature in the bending of light and the falling of
apples to the ground. The particles in the light or the apple are tracing a line through history, through spacetime. This line
is as straight as it can be given the space it must traverse, but because this space is curved, strange things happen, like the
lensing of light or the falling of apples.

I kept thinking about general relativity, because the rubber sheet metaphors used to explain it confused me. They described things
rolling along and falling into depressions in a sheet, but falling requires a force perpendicular to the sheet, and that's what
the metaphor is supposed to explain. A stationary thing won't feel gravity? It isn't moving across the sheet, right? It just sits there,
blithely ignorant of the divot made by the bowling ball sitting next to it. For it to roll down the slop into the divot would require
acceleration, and the curved rubber sheet itself is supposed to explain acceleration.

I hadn't taken the general relativity course in the physics sequences -- I dropped out after
quantum mechanics -- or I would have known that the lines in the metaphor were temporal, as described above: nothing is stationary,
because its existence from moment to moment describes a line through space*time*. Because everything is a line, distortions in
spacetime affect even stationary things.
