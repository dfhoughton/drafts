# Ethics and Procrastination

A thought occurred to me as I lay in bed this morning hoping to fall back asleep: procrastination is the handmaiden of evil.

There's a Simpson's episode in which Homer stays home from church while the rest of his family attends. It is freezing cold outside, so cold the doors of the church freeze shut. Meanwhile, Homer lies in bed ensconced in the remains of a gluttonous feast. He is indulging all his carnal impulses and regretting nothing. He finds he has to pee but he doesn't want to get out of his warm nest. "Think, Homer, think," he says and gazes speculatively at the ceiling, hoping some idea will come to him that will allow him to relieve his bladder while not getting up. (In the end he gets up.)

This illustrates, I think, the basic rationale of procrastination: if you don't like your choices in the moment, just wait. Maybe something better will come along. And sometimes it does works. You can sometimes wait and see.

The problem with learning this lesson too well is that it is the general way we offload responsibility onto a future someone. The next person will take out the trash. Future innovation will solve climate change. Someone else will take down the tyrant.

Feel pangs of guilt about stolen resources you enjoy? Just wait! Maybe someone will come up with a superior rationalization. Maybe the victims of the theft will die, go away, or give up. Maybe you will die and your descendants, who will inherit the pelf, can take up the puzzle. A bladder has physical limits. Our consciences are infinitely elastic.
