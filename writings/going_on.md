# I can't go on. I must go on. I will go on.

Here is a story about me as a little boy.

I lived in Annandale, Virginia, in Fairfax County. Up the street from me was Wakefield Forest Elementary School, where I was a student. I'm not sure just what year this was when the event I'm about to narrate happened, but it was before I was in the 5th grade, because I left Wakefield Forest for a different school, Pine Ridge, in the 5th grade. I think it was before the 4th grade as well, because in the 4th grade I was growing alienated from my friends at Wakefield Forest, and at the time in question I was not yet alienated. In fact, I did not yet have many of the friends I was to grow alienated from. It may have been when I was in the 2nd grade. In short, I was very young.

My best friend since kindergarten was John Brennan. He lived in Truro, a planned development organized around parks, trails, and a central recreation area with a swimming pool. The houses were all of a fixed number of plans, maybe just four or five. They all had similar, tasteful exteriors and landscaping: dark brown wood siding and brick. Central courtyards were a theme. Cul-de-sacs (culs-de-sac) were a theme. The streets curved and wound organically.

I lived in a older neighborhood with a more rectilinear street plan. The houses all looked similar, but only because the people who built them all had similar, middle class taste. If some central planner planned it, it wasn't someone looking to create a theme other than continuing home sales.

Wakefield Forest lay midway between me and John. Mostly I walked over to his house. Sometimes he walked to mine. I'd go down the street, then up the small hill to Wakefield Forest. I'd cut across the grassy rectangular athletic field behind, then down an abrupt slope, through a dark little triangular spinney of sapling pine trees and brambles, and onto the sidewalk of Iva Lane. (Truro had sidewalks.) From there it was a short, curvy walk to John's cul-de-sac.

The dark spinney was full of trash. This bothered me. One day, when John was over at my house I thought, "Let's clean it up!" I suggested this to John. I was enthusiastic. He was amenable. I opened the louvred doors of our pantry closet, dug out two black plastic garbage bags, and we headed off to pick up the trash.

When we crested the low hill which sloped down to the athletic field, we could see a group of boys with a football. It was the male kids from a blended family we knew in Truro. They also went to Wakefield Forest. (I remember their surname but will not use it. They likely don't remember any of this.) I was a little nervous -- they never seemed that friendly -- but we headed past them to the spinney.

At this point my memory of the events are jumbled. The fear and adrenaline broke everything up into snapshots and short snippets. They asked what we were doing, I said we were going to pick up the trash. They thought we were better sport than football and chased us back and forth, trying to put us into our garbage bags. I don't think they all arrived at this plan simultaneously. One of the older ones initiated it and the younger ones were accustomed to following his lead.

I can feel it in my body: the effort, dashing, and dodging, the fear of the larger, faster, stronger boys pursuing me, the humiliation and mockery, the cruelty. I can see the black mouth of the bag coming at me.

Then they decided they'd had enough of this fun and let us go.

I think we did pick up some of the trash. It was mostly soda cans.

Anyway, the sense of the terror and injustice stuck with me, a tiny early episode of PTSD. 

This particular memory is in my mind now because it echoes with the current moment. The world is being trashed. Our country is being trashed. I have decided I should do something about it. I am sure many people agree that something should be done, just as I'm sure everyone walking among the pine saplings wished there was less trash. But when I go out in public to say "Hey! Let's do something!" No one joins me. A few people metaphorically try to shove me into my own garbage bag.

These events that I've planned I've announced with only short warning. I wasn't expecting much. I didn't have a great plan. I just wanted to be an example of standing up. Everyone is keeping their head down, trying to avoid notice, hoping someone else will fix things. But Keeping your head down makes the heads more visible of those standing up.

This is more important than trash in the woods.

Why did I title this "I can't go on. I must go on. I will go on."? The first is how I feel. The second is my obligation. The third follows from the second. It is how I live my life when life is hard.

There have been two prominent suicides in my life. When I was a child, my uncle Bill took his own life. I thought about this off and on over the years. I had few stories of Bill. That was part of the horror of his death: no one was telling his story. Then a little over two years ago my son Jude took his life. I will not narrate that. It is a story I have told elsewhere. I was in therapy for a year or so after his death. One of the things I told my therapist again and again was that however I felt I would not kill myself. I felt I could not go on. But I had to go on. I had to go on for those who loved me. I couldn't leave them bereft. So I did go on. I am going on.

If you see someone standing up for you, maybe think of this. Maybe they are just going on. And maybe give them a hand.

[Footnote. I say above, "no one joins me." This is not true. The first time my daughter Cassie, my wife PJ, and my sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Rolf, joined me. The second time, PJ joined me. She will keep joining me. I meant when I broadcast the invitation to the world, on Facebook and Bluesky, there were no takers.]
